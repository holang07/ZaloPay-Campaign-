# ZaloPay-Campaign-
**Situation**
- Zalopay launched a referred-based promotion. It aims to acquire new mapped users (users who link a bank card) and new paying users (users who complete their first fund-in or payment)
- The campaign rewards the sender with 50,000 VND when receivers click a referral link, links a bank card and complete a fund-in/payment. The receiver also receives vouchers as an incentive.

**Complication**
Due to reward structure, the campaign is susceptible to bot-driven abuse that can be simulated user behaviors such as auto-clicks, mass account creation, scripted bank linking... to farm rewards fraudulently. As a result:
- Wasted campaign budget
- Skewed user acquisition metrics
- Increased system load and risk
- Reduce trust in campaign performance, so that customer experience is affected

**Questions**
How can Zalopay effectively detect and mitigate bot-driven abuse during the campaign while ensuring the experience for users?

**Findings**
Task 1: Based on Mapcard process, figure out on which steps potentially abused, and then, use dataset to define the logic of detecting bot-driven abuse.
Task 2: Visualize and do analysis on how impactful of users that is driven by bot/automation
Task 3: Propose the strategic and management plan
